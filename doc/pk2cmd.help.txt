M<memory region>     Program Device                           Do Not Program
                     memory regions:
                         P = Program memory
                         E = EEPROM
                         I = ID memory
                         C = Configuration memory
                         If no region is entered, the entire
                         device will be erased & programmed.
                         If a region is entered, no erase
                         is performed and only the given
                         region is programmed.
                         All programmed regions are verified.

N<string>            Assign Unit ID string to first found     None
                     PICkit 2 unit.  String is limited to 14
                     characters maximum.  May not be used
                     with other options.
                     Example: -NLab1B
P<part>              Part Selection. Example: -PPIC16f887     (Required)
P                    Auto-Detect in all detectable families
PF                   List auto-detectable part families
PF<id>               Auto-Detect only within the given part
                     family, using the ID listed with -PF
                     Example: -PF2
Q                    Disable PE for PIC24/dsPIC33 devices     Use PE
R                    Release /MCLR after operations           Assert /MCLR
S<string/#>          Use the PICkit 2 with the given Unit ID  First found unit
                     string.  Useful when multiple PICkit 2
                     units are connected.
                     Example: -SLab1B
                     If no <string> is entered, then the
                     Unit IDs of all connected units will be
                     displayed.  In this case, all other 
                     options are ignored. -S# will list units
                     with their firmware versions.
                     See help -s? for more info.

U<value>             Program OSCCAL memory, where:            Do Not Program
                      <value> is a hexadecimal number
                      representing the OSCCAL value to be
                      programmed. This may only be used in
                      conjunction with a programming 
                      operation.

     Each option must be immediately preceeded by a switch, Which can
     be either a dash <-> or a slash </> and options must be separated
     by a single space.

     Example:   PK2CMD /PPIC16F887 /Fc:\mycode /M
                               or
                PK2CMD -PPIC16F887 -Fc:\mycode -M

     Any option immediately followed by a question mark will invoke
     a more detailed description of how to use that option.

     Commands and their parameters are not case sensitive. Commands will
     be processed according to command order of precedence, not the order
     in which they appear on the command line. 
	Precedence:
                -?      (first)
                -B
                -S
                -D
                -N
                -P
                -A -F -J -L -Q -V -W -X -Z
                -C

     The program will return an exit code upon completion which will
     indicate either successful completion, or describe the reason for
     failure. To view the list of exit codes and their descriptions,
     type -?E on the command line.

     type -?V on the command line for version information.

     type -?L on the command line for license information.

     type -?P on the command line for a listing of supported devices.
     type -?P<string> to search for and display a list of supported devices
                      beginning with <string>.
